# Volumetric-Rendering-Using-NeRF
This isa  minimal implementation of the research paper NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis by Ben Mildenhall et. al. The authors have proposed an ingenious way to synthesize novel views of a scene by modelling the volumetric scene function through a neural network.
The quetion is: would it be possible to give to a neural network the position of a pixel in an image, and ask the network to predict the color at that position?
